I have noticed a distinct lack of tools for visualizing in 3D more technical systems, everywhere you look you can find libraries for 3D, but they really focus on the artistic and design side of things. I wanted to create something that could be used for remote vision systems or physics models and visualizing robotic sensor information. Things like that. I understand the speed gap that web technology faces when compared to more native tools such as c, c++ based graphics libraries, but I think the portability and ease of access adds a lot that you have to go through extra hoops with native languages to get. To note, I don't see this necessarily as an industrial applied software, but for DIY people a plug and play experience, built around the library and then of-course the accompanying library open to anyone who wants it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n-Base systems for orthographic and perspective based 3d \r\n\r\n-Mathematical functions that assist with graphics computations\r\n\r\n-A few basic shapes (Cube,Sphere) plans to add a variety of shapes over time.\r\n\r\n-Phong shading, flat shading.\r\n\r\n-Object composition, add basic shapes to a mesh object, this mesh object acts as a single object at render time, allows handling of large amounts of objects (Tested about 100k cubes spinning on screen with above 30fps on a fairly average computer) \r\n\r\n### TODO (Upcoming Features)\r\n\r\n-More advanced benchmark than my 100k cubes spinning test. (Gathering actual comparison data between this library and native code as well as not necessarily mechanical systems focused but fast nonetheless libraries like Three.js) \r\n\r\n-Point cloud and particle representations\r\n\r\n-Basic physics system capabilities\r\n\r\n-More advanced manipulation of single objects added to meshes. (Figuring out a fast way of calculating offsets in the meshes vertex buffer for each object and applying transformations without affecting another object, allowing for individual object manipulations in meshed objects.) \r\n\r\n-Integration with common DIY kits such as arduino and r-pi. Hopefully extend beyond these kits in to other areas.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently the sole work of @grandathepanda.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to assist or request features go right ahead, contact me through github or at itb206(at)nyu(dot)edu. The project is also MIT licensed so feel free to fork and do whatever you want! I would consider this library to be in beta stages, there still needs to be work done to make this an every day usable library for modeling physical systems on the web and handling integration with other common robotics tools.
